# R_TEST
A simple program for C program IO testing. Written in Rust, using concurrency to speed up valgrind testing.
Make sure to update settings at your first run of the program!

# INFORMATION
1. Every path should be in its absolute version (other version may work but it's not guaranteed).
2. Program needs a compiled version of other program to perform input/output tests.
3. .in with input, .out with stdout, .err with stderr should be in the same folder, which path is set in program's configuration.
